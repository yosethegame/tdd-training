# Introduction

Introduce yourself and the agenda for the day
* Introduction
* Coding-dojos
* PrimeFactor kata
* YoseTheGame: the World PrimeFactor
* Professionalism

Capture for all to see the expectations and concerns the participants have for this session.

Every sharing moment is an invitation for debates during the training. Adopt a curious stance and welcome emotional reactions.

Regular breaks will help sustainable pace. Head up the class every 45 minutes and invite them to take a break.

# Coding dojos

Share with the participants the intentions of the coding-dojos practice. 
Share the following list of intentions (or another that makes more sense for you):
* Learning by repetition
* Create reflexes given a specific situation
* practice TDD
* practice Refactoring
* practice your hability to identify code smells
* practice pair-programming
* practice anything that you identify as a weakness in your programming skills

Share (draw / slide) your favorite TDD cycle. Might contain 3 or more steps.
Example:
* Test
* Improve error message
* Code
* Refactor
* A second loop starting from Refactor: Test - Code

Share external resources, for example:
* coding-dojos: http://codingdojo.org/
* code smells: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CodeSmell
 
Share, run and comment one video about you or someone else doing a kata. Choose a short video and choose another kata than the PrimeFactor kata. Discuss the difference between randoris and katas.

Share the idea of Coding-dojos 2.0:
* historical coding-dojos are algorithm challenges
* for some people, it makes sense to practice with more elaborated challenges including Web concerns, GUI, Persistance, etc. We call those Coding-dojos 2.0

http://yosethegame.com/ can be seen as a platform that invite you to practice Coding-dojos 2.0

# PrimeFactors kata

Present the challenge. 

Alternate between moments where you let the participants focus on their work and moments where you share all together. During the focused-on-work time frames, you might ask a quick question to highlight something specific you want them to keep in mind.

Encourage the participants to start over. A common trap is to try to solve the PrimeFactors decomposition challenge and to forget that they are here to study TDD. Take the time to welcome their inconfort to start over if they want to complete their algorithm first. 

Let the participants form pairs or work alone. Declare yourself available to help. Likely nobody will ask you for help at the beginning. Enjoy your break while they break a sweat.

During the focused-on-work moments, ask questions that call for short answers like:
* in which step of the TDD cycle are you now ?
* how long since you get feedback from your tests ?
* how long between your last red and green again ?
* for those in Refactoring, what code smells are you working on ?

During the sharing moments, share your thoughts and facilitate discussions about:
* What did they learn ?
* What was their first test ?
* Could your first test be about the decomposition of 300? If so, what would be the audience of this test? 
* Would you put together tests with different audience?
* What was their second test ?
* Highlight the different test strategies if any
* Take the time to study how they made pass the first test. Was the smell MagicNumber present after the first green? If so, how did they refactor it?
* Do they have any Duplication in the tests? Point out the different type of Duplication: data and algorithm
* Ask the participants about the names of their tests. Present the BadName smell. Discuss about the intentions of a test, the actual test name, and the actual content of the test. An discrepancies? Any chance that someone else in 6 months from now could understand their test strategy?
* How can you take advantage of a watch while practicing tdd ?
* Present ListenToTheTest
* Present BrokenTest and invite the participants to use it before breaks, lunch, end of day
* TDD is a design technique
* ...

Share with the participants your favorite code smells and how you use them. You might say things like:
* My best friends are BadName, PrimitiveObsession, Swith, MagicNumber
* Those are invitations to reconsider my current code
* Study different code smells and know your best friends
* Come back to them when you don't have any intuition about your code
* Know the favorite smells of your teammates
* Try new code smells regularly

Repeat as much as you need it before going to the game.


# YoseTheGame

Participants access their dashboard, navigate to the Power of two challenge and click the Try button. 

Point out how a written specification can be unclear vs how a test gives you specific expectations.

As they likely already have ready somewhere their implementation of the PrimeFactors kata, they should be able to pass this first challenge easily. They will likely not write any new tests at this point and try to go fast to green in the game.

Repeat the dynamic of alternance between focused-on-work moments and sharing moments.

During the focused-on-work moment, continue to ask short questions to create the habit of always knowing what you are doing, what is your current intention, how long wihout feedback.

Share when appropriate for you your thoughts about:
* test pyramid, its evolution in time
* outside-in tdd vs inside-out tdd
* London vs Chicago
* London + Chicago !
* Commit policy and TDD cycle
* ATDD, BDD, TDD?

# Professionalism

Common questions: until when do I refactor ? When do I stop refactoring ?

mmm...

TDD

First, I design/write a test, then I green it as fast as possible, then I refactor my code. When I make the code pass, I'm "authorized" to write any crapy code I need to green the test (yes even copy/paste code). 

When I refactor I make the code ready so that I can green the next test very fast. In real life, I might not even know what the next test will be. Remember that coding-dojos are about practising ourself to take advantage of this practise in the "real world" where uncertainty is the rule. Ideally, I refactor to be ready to welcome ...anything. "Welcome change even late in the development" should remind you something. Gosh, this seems hard. Yes it is, we are profesionals, our art is difficult. Stop reafctoring when you are ready to welcome change, when you trust that your velocity will stay stable.

When I design/write test, I'm identifying what I need from that software. In real life, I might have to collaborate with a customer (!) to identify what we need to build. He/She might be very unclear about what he needs. When we know in our brain what we need, we identify maybe a list of tests, we write a test, designing at the same time the architecture that we need. Gosh, this seems hard too. Yes it is, we are professionals, our art is difficult.

When I code, I can write crappy code. It does not seem very professional.

You probably act more like a Professional during the Test and Refactor steps than in the Code step.

What if software developers were hired for their hability to write tests and refactor code, rather then for their hability to write code ?
